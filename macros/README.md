# Macros

Recorded macros are saved here as JSON files via `record_macro()` in `modules.automation_learning`.
You can also place Python scripts in this folder and load them as plugins using `modules.macro_loader`.

## Example

`sample_open_notepad.json` demonstrates a simple macro that clicks, types `notepad`, and presses Enter. Run it with `play macro sample_open_notepad` from the assistant.
